### Node JS Master Class code

This repo contains code developed as a part of the [Node JS Master class](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/take/the-nodejs-master-class/lessons/3810868-logging-to-files).


### Notes

- The `.data` folder has not been .gitignored purposefully so that the code will run as is. 
- To set and unset the environment variables in power shell   
  ```shell
  $Env:NODE_DEBUG = 'workers'
  Remove-Item Env:NODE_DEBUG
  ```
